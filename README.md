# Portfolio Site for Joey Campos

### Purpose
I built this portfolio website as a way to showcase some of my professional work as a 
Full Stack Web Developer. The projects shown on the "Professional Work" page of my site are ones that 
are talked about in my resume. You can click on each project card to see further details.

### Design
This site has a mobile-first design and uses Bootstrap v5.3. I will continue
to update and modify this project as needed.

### Website
