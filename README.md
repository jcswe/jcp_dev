# Portfolio Site for Joey Campos

### Purpose
I built this website as a way to showcase examples of my professional work as a 
full stack web developer. The projects shown on the "Work" page of my site are ones that 
are talked about in my resume. You can click on each project thumbnail to see further details.

### Design
This site has a mobile-first design and uses vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. I will continue
to update and modify this project as needed.

### Website
You can visit my website [here]().
